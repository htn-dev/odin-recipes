    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a breeze to make in the air fryer, and we like to serve it with sliced cherry tomatoes, freshly-chopped herbs or occasionally a drizzle of balsamic glaze.</p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces halloumi cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Slice halloumi into 6 equal slices, cut each slice in half, and dry with a paper towel. Brush all sides with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Lightly spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place the halloumi slices in the basket, making sure they're not touching. You may have to cook in two batches,</li>
        <li>Cook for 7 to 9 minutes until golden brown, but make sure not to overcook or they turn rubbery. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
